Jasmeet Singh,4,Good choice,"Benefits :- cheap, fits properly in ur ear, sound quality is better, battery backup is good, good design. Know worse things:- bass is too solid that voice truely becomes a noise in ur ears, range to the connected device is around 10 mtrs. But still is a very good call in this range. I conside it to be purchased."

Alham  Noor,1,Don't waste your money,"First of all decent design but...tbh sound quality is not so decent as I was expecting way better it's only ""thump"" in the sound , calling is okay ,touch controls are pretty impressive battery backup is quite good but still the issue remains sound quality is not good"

Babaiah D,5,Must buy!,Excellent product in this price range. Received in Good condition Thanks to Flipkart. Box is glossy and soon gets scratches. it will Good if they provide Pouch to the Box.Sound quality is Great no Anti Noice Cancellation.Overall Nice product from NOISE .......👋👋👋👌👌👌👌
Flipkart Customer,2,Moderate,Songs wise listening is good experience but call experience is very poor call gets disconnected if u accidentally touch earphones also battery backup is not good instead if u go for wired Bluetooth earphone they have great battery backup also design nd build wise while u r outdoors it's quite difficult to take calls and u have to speak loudly!Not worth buying instead go for wired earphones!
Flipkart Customer,5,Must buy!,"Its a honest review after 6 months of usage Really awesome product Has an extraordinary bass Clear audio without any harshness in the music Battery life is good If anyone is looking for earbuds,I suggest you to Buy this"

Akash Bhakat,4,Nice product,"I have used it more than 15 days. It is pretty good product. Bass and sound quality is much good. Battery backup is also very good. Design is good but as I have used it for 2hrs continuously in 70% volume, I feel pain in my ears."
Rinshu Raj,4,Value-for-money,"My structure review after using it for more than 10 days:- Not for gaming stuffs.- sound quality is good.- Bass is good but not too good.- Design and build is top notch.- Touch is working fine.If you are someone who just want to do your work like studying, listening music in free time then just go for this product. It is very good in that sense but if you're thinking to buy this for gaming and stuff then this one is not a best option."

Charging capacity is good, it sustains for a longer duration and gets charged instantly. Left & Right, both the Buds syncs fast.Using it with Apple devices, bring the best of it. The finger tap feature is also of great help. Switching between Apple Devices is very easy and fast.It detects ear-presence and your device behaves accordingly.Good point, that it can be used anywhere,..."
Mohammed Naved,5,Just wow!,"Sound quality is good moreover voice calling is also available but sometimes it doesn't works properly...overall it's good, as a matter of fact I bought it for 899 and what else you expect in this price range?"

Abhishek Kannan,5,Worth every penny,"To be honest before i ordered these i had no expectations. But when i got them and on the first try it blew my mind. Seriously it's really good for this amount of price.PROS :-~ good sound~ decent bass~ comfortable fit~ value for moneyCONS:-~ too glossy, gets scratches fast (from my pov)~ only one led indicator on the case."
Litton Behera,5,Simply awesome,"I have been using this ear buds since 9 th January 2023 .its so easy to use and connect with smartphone and the main features about product this is that I must have to is noise cancellation it's amazing, you can believe my experience,that if I will tell you when I  put this on ear the surrounding goes silent no noises are there I totally impressed with this product . obviously i recomment to buy this . it's amazing 😍"
Flipkart Customer,4,Wonderful,"Got it for 799 during big billion days sales. It's definitely worth the amount paid. Coming to sound quality, it lacks that balanced sound output. Bass totally overshadows and miss vocal clarity and high frequency most of the times. Bass heads might like it. Touch controls works well. Call clarity is average. Overall a good deal."
Achint Rout,3,Does the job,I am giving this review after using 1 month. Battery back up is superb of both buds and casing. Sound is good in the price. If you are purchasing for calling purpose only then don't buy. Straight range is good and connectivity but down ward or upward range is very less. But for 1st use you can go for it. Worth of money.
Washim  Sajjad,4,Worth the money,"The functionality is pretty decent. All the specified touch responses are functioning properly. But, one should not except refined sound quality. It has a balance sound quality. I am happy with this headphone."

The battery backup is stellar! Overall pretty satisfied."

I mean even when you adjust the buds in your ears, either the volume increases or the songs keep skipping or something else happens. It's annoying to say the least. They could have at least given the option of disabling the touch options completely. It's only because of the sensitive touch I'm not able to use these buds at all. Can't even return"

Mukesh  sharma,4,Wonderful,Good
Sumiran Dewan,4,Very Good,"For a non tech savvy person like me it is a simple enough product that does it's job. Music sounds fine enough but call is not very clear. For a person like me who only uses earphones for 1-2 hours a day, the case needs charging only around twice a week. Colour is more like baby blue. Case material feels like cheap plastic but for the price paid it's acceptable. Touch function is highly sensitive and even a slight movement of your hair might change/pause the music or raise/ lower the volume."

I liked everything about this product except the bass, though the bass is not at all bad , but i think compare to boat this headphones has less bass. If the headphones are charged till it gets fully charged then u would definitely get backup more than 8 hours. Overall the Product is very nice."

Vikas Patil,4,Worth the money,I am writing this review after 2 and a half months of using it there are the points i want to tell 1. If you want them for bass i don't prefer to use it.2. Best for gaming purpose. 3. Calling voice is perfect no laging nothing.4. Best build quality of case and ear pods.5. Ear pods size is little small for me it comes with size of 1/2 inches.6. Worth of money nothing is bad in such cheap price just wait for offer. 7. I brought them just for 999 rupees.

Garima  Awasthi,5,Worth every penny,"And yes there you go...You have the best in-budget tws....First of all, let me get something straight- It has amazing sound quality A decent bass A nice battery backup But it lacks only in built design. Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...Just go for it"
Divyanshu Singh,5,Great product,Satisfying . Received today morning. Continuously using this earpods for 3 hrs and still battery is at 90% . So all good. Base can be better but good at this price. Good at calling also. I can hear voice while riding and that's really good. Overall worth buying.
Pratik Trivedi,4,Nice product,"Very good option at this pricePros: Build quality, clear sound, Lightweight, branded product at low price, perfect fitting, insta wake up technology Good bass and sound(by using other music players mentioned below) Cons: Low bass which can control by other music players like Google play music, Dub music player or third party equaliser app. You will get perfect sound by playing music on this players."
Kumar Gaurav,5,Great product,"Everything is fine, just need improve the bass, and one thing many users have said does not work one side, tell them u reset once  and then both will work, the battery is very good and excellent performance but many people will have a slight pain in the ear while using it first time, but will not do it when they get used to it after a few days, in the last I will just say that u will not get any good from it at such a low price,  THANKS boAt INDIA & THANKS Flipkart😍😍"
Prince Verma,5,Best in the market!,Superb 🙂🙂Overall boat 131 is awesome . But it should have a touch control sensor instead multi function button . According to me Bass quality is great . No calling issue till i had use . Song quality also fabulous .

Anurag Yadav,4,Delightful,Good product with fine looks. Bass is not super good but it is ok u can feel beats.connectivity is good overall product is good but one thing hurts me is that it is not waterproof 😭 and this is a issue for me rest I am happy because it's design is pretty cool . I had  already one plus wireless earphone but whenever I use it it's neck wire irritates me😂
Danish  Lilu,5,Great product,Very Good 😌 Product Battery backup super awesome boss not a perfect but Good 😌 sound quality always good 😌

Dhruv Shah,3,Nice,OkUpdated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.
Prashant  Kalebag,4,Worth the money,Bass is not upto the mark. Sound quality is excellent. Cryastal clear sound. Boat should improve the bass quality in this airdopes. Boats other headphones having best bass .overall it's good and value for money.
Rushabh Chandra,4,Wonderful,Thank you flipkart for the fastest delivery got this airdopes delivered within 24 hrs ....  I have been fan of boat from past 3 years and I have been using boat rockerz bluetooth earphones and then I ordered this one amazing one in this price point ...Waiting for the another sale so that I can order one more ....Thumbs Up👍Must buy product ❤️
Chaitanya Lad,4,Very Good,"I ordered the product in the sale on 22nd Aug & immediately received it on the morning of 23rd Aug.I must say at this price point the product is quite good. Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.Rest as of now is great. Time shall tell how great this product is."

Flipkart Customer,1,Worst experience ever!,"Not at all for bass lover. The music just seems to be soft nor is it loud, there's no loudness at all. According to the price it should've been a bit more worth it building up the bass & for bass lovers there's no bass at all. Giving an honest review from the day of purchase & delivered."
Ritik Gautam,1,Hated it!,Although design is gud in look but the sound quality is cheapest...not only cheapest...its too cheapest and annoying...😣Not satisfied at this price... Boat rockerzz 255 is too much better then these eardopes at this price rate... 👎👎👎I have boat eardopes 281 which is also very good in sound and design...

Pooja Gupta,4,Good quality product,It's good but there bass is not good otherwise sounds so good nd clear and it's model so well easily carry anywhere.
RAM Chintapalli,3,Good,"This product sound quality and comfort is good, fit very well in my ears. It is suitable for Music only not for the calls, receiver is too bad. Connection gets interrupted when moving to another room, so connection range isn't  great, just Okay.It's my first airdopes, got them for 1274/- and overall recommended for this price."
Flipkart Customer,3,Decent product,Nice colour and to cute sound quality is good hope it works well
Malay Pandey,5,Just wow!,"It is definitely a good purchase at this price, those who don't care for loud bass and thing, they can go for this, these Airdopes are perfectly balanced in terms of sound, the sound doesn't breaks at high volumes, you can still enjoy your songs smoothly. The normal calling with this works perfectly, no as such issues there, but you may find bit issues on WhatsApp calls, as voice tends to break sometimes. You can use one airdope at a time and it works perfectly.Lastly, the battery backup, i..."

Jai Chhatpar,4,Value-for-money,"The earphone got delivered in 1 day. Speaking of sound quality the sound is good you get decent amount of base for the price. The design though is not upto the mark you cannot wear it for prolonged hours as it gets uncomfortable. The microphone is ok calling experience is ok not that great. Battery backups i cannot comment on that as I haven’t used it a lot. But for the price that you are paying ,this thing is totally worth the buy."
Aditya Singh,5,Just wow!,Best product but bass is less battery is also best design is also best and sound quality is also best but bass is less
Ankur Govil,5,Fabulous!,"It's nice overall mainly because of the low price. It has pressable button towards the outer part by pressing which one can receive/reject call, play/pause music. The bass is not upto the mark. Call quality is nice. But what else you need for such low cost. Good for those who don't like in-ear silicone earphones."
Sandeep Mishra,5,Must buy!,"So actually these are very impressive at such low price. Boat has been always knows for delivering great sound. Its just the product quality should have been a bit more high because it will get scratches on the go.. One thing is that you cannot hold it for longer as the ear start paining. short duration is ok to use. I already owe One plus z buds , those are really very comfy. Haven't tested the backup but I believe it will pass that too.♥️The sound part is actually a bit heavy and not so c..."
Satish Mishra,3,Decent product,Charging and look are good but sound is bad sound of right eardopes are very less compare to left one and bass is also nice but fitting in ear is good but after some times it will pain.Overall I give it 3/5.
DEEPIKA Vashist,5,Highly recommended,"The best in class airdopes. Great sound, perfect fit and at this price it's just awesome. Highly recommended.The only issue is that Boat has mentioned additional earmuffs with the package but it is not available in the box or it is missing."

Abhishek Mandal,4,Wonderful,"Exactly as I needed. Half in-ear. got it for 999. Bass is good. I can hear outer sounds so i dont need to take this out for talking to someone. This is better than Boult Tws Freepods in mic quality. Calling Mic is good but if you turn on Fan, it will sound like talking inside water. Mic quality of Boat 402 is better. There is no microphone hole, I blow air anywhere and it is audible. looks like mic takes audio from the body vocal vibration. An oppo or vivo or Samsung earphone wired of 180 Rs ..."

Gaurav Singh,4,Pretty good,Good Earpodes by Boat... But it could be a lill better in terms of bass and battery life... otherwise very good in this price range.
Flipkart Customer,3,Does the job,The sound quality is good in this price. The battery backup is nice I use it all the time still I have charged it 1 time in 4-5 days. This thing I really like.I don't like it design as it kept on falling from ears it kind of frustrating. If you are thinking to buy this for gym workout or running it not suitable.
Atif Khan,5,Super!,I think it is worth....Sound :- Sound quality is good but sometime music is stop for mili sec...btw in this price range no company provide like this...Build quality :-is good but the blue blinking light irritate me and beacuse of blue light it looks cheap...Battery :- good battery backup ...no problem
Sajida Sau,5,Brilliant,"Liked the product. However, this one is not for the music lover. But for general use, its amazing. Battery life cant say much as its too early. The best thing is it matches my bedroom wall...well be a little cautious with the colors they are not exactly how it is shown in the pics. Mine turned more towards baby pink..."

mahesh wankhede,4,Pretty good,"If you are looking for a earbuds only listening music then its a good choice but not good for communication.While talking on phone or laptops second person is not able to here your voice clearly i.e. not good in connectivity.Bass is not good, its average.Build quality and battery life is extremely great."
Nripen Mondal,5,Just wow!,Mind blowing parches. Very nice headset in low budget. Go for it. I think this is the best in this price range. I ordered on 22 August and got it on 23 August. Very fast delivery. Thanks flipkart.
Deepak Mandal,4,Good choice,Firstly its the best at this price..overall the sound is good..it fits good in the ears but pains after using an hour or later continuously..it feels light ..noise cancellation is an issue in this as the traffic sounds can be heard while using this..battery capacity is good as i currently charged it two days ago and have used it for more than 5-6 hours daily yet its not drainedLastly this is the best product at this price..can say the cheapest with a good quality
Swati Aradhana,5,Simply awesome,It is the best gifted item ever with in the price range I personally use airpod i purchased it to gift someone and I compared it to my AirPods all designs and connectivity is same and good built up only think the blinking light is really irritating and sound clarity is also good range power is also nice I highly recommended it if u r having less budget

Ankit Joshi,3,Just okay,Sound quality while listening music is really good but the problem is quality while calling.I am able to hear perfectly on a call but the person on the other side is not able to hear my voice properly..i guess the mic of my buds is very bad. If u want them just for enjoying music and watching videos then its ok..but if you'll be using them for calling plz don't buy them.

Flipkart Customer,4,Nice product,"So,Okay. I don't know why I was thinking it would be a bit larger in size. But all and all, a really good product. BOAT never Disappoints. The sound quality is really clear. Don't expect alot of Bass from it though. But it's really nice that it lacks a bit Bass, and has a really clear sound quality. It just arrived so I'm not sure about the battery backup feature. But, I'm really happy with the product.the colours would come a bit lighter in shade. I chose Cherry blossom, but it's more lik..."
Thiyagarajan Ramachandran,4,Pretty good,"All are excellent but it is not connected well with Microsoft Teams call because in other end can't hear properly, so unable to use it for official call. But if you're using only with mobile then it's too good without any doubt. Additionally, it won't block your ear hole fully so you'll get enough ventilation for your ear which eliminate ear problems."

Mohammad Akbar Yattoo,5,Wonderful,It has good sound quality.. It has good voice assistant... Totally value for money.. I think it is the best in this price range...
Aiswarya Surendran,1,Hated it!,"The product I have received had two loners of some estranged pair, each had different shades of the colour I have ordered it in, and the newfound pair was a total misfit, awww cute... 😍 The design is an art, really who would put such a null to nothing of their creativity just for our experience of total comfort. With the design and unmatched weight scale accuracy of those so-called tiny earbuds I was left with an unbearable headache and in-ear pain I even got to experience vertigo for 1st ..."

Harbir Waan,3,Decent product,"I wish to point out one very basic thing the earbuds are designed well but the material used for covering the sound outlet is no good it in good brands its steel or metal based very fine mesh, in this case it  just came out to be nothing but a cloth based thin layer pasted with low quality glue. Not a good experience. Earbud without this cover is firstly exposed and not so appealing anymore."
Pratik Upadhyay,5,Perfect product!,I love this products I purchase Rs 999 and very full satisfied also recommend to purchase this products.. I used someday after I type this review..

Bhanu Deep  Juneja,5,Simply awesome,This pair of headset is perfectly fine and worth every penny. The sound quality is absolutely clear with defined bass. Mic works perfectly fine. Also perfectly suitable for people who wear earphones during driving. Though it is risky but still works absolutely good. Battery is good. Perfect airdopes at reasonable price.
Mohanrao Korakuti,4,Nice product,"This is good only... If your looking for fast beat with high bass, then don't go with this product. Else go for it and it will be worth for amount."
Nikhil  Ranjan ,5,Classy product,"Fabulous just can say this word only. Awesome design, awesome fitting and loved the Voice ..  A+"
Kritika Chauhan,5,Simply awesome,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it. 3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look."

Neh ,4,Wonderful,"Some of the reviews here are overrated. - The battery backup is really nice. - No compatibility problems, however it doesn't support AAC sound attributes in some devices. - One of my Pods has excellent bass, the other one's okay. - Mono pod feature works well- You can't control the volume with these, it has to be controlled by device you're connected to. Probably the best you can get for 1300 INR"

Pankaj Panjwani,5,Just wow!,"I have been using Boat products since it was launched. I can vouch for their quality and durability. I am still using Boat Rockers 400 which is now almost 3 years old. Now coming to the product, they are very lightweight and handy, no need to power on and off just remove from box and voila they get connected to the phone.

Arif Shaikh,5,Great product,Awesome product at very affordable great price. Very good and fine quality of sound for music and calls.Mic reception during calls is little weak in outdoor noisy places but works fine at indoor places.Great deal on Flipkart at budget cost. Fast delivery and quality of service by Flipkart.Unbelievable product at this price. A must have product.
NIKAY BESA Konyak,3,Does the job,"Review after 5 months:  Not good for calling. It doesn't receive voice properly and the listener doesn't hear well. It pains my ear as the buds are too big...Sound wise, it's good for listening music. Battery quality is good. Very easy and convenient to use."
Pranesh Rajkumar,4,Really Nice,Great in terms of the build and fitment. Instantly pairs with the last paired device and this is just great. Helps when you get a call and need to answer it immediately. Fits the ear perfectly and doesn’t fall out when walking or running.One shortcoming would be the bass - this is almost like null! For a WFH scenario perfect companion!

Rajath Gopinath,5,Classy product,"Sound clarity is really awesome and there could be very few songs which you may be able to hear in full volume. The quality of the case(airdope charger)seems slightly inferior. Overall great value for money. Since I have just purchased the product, will not be able to comment on battery backup and recharging convenience."
Saumik Bhattacharjee,3,Does the job,"Pros: 1. Premium look2. Comparatively cheap3. Good battery backupCons:1. Design is such, that initially it will make your ears pain2. After few months connectivity will slow down3. Charging of the one ear bud stopped after 4-5 monthsOverall one can give this product a try, but there is no guarantee that the unit purchased will last long without any fault. Not very satisfied with the product."

Bipasha Chakraborty ,5,Simply awesome,"Let's talk about battery backup first... It stay charged for 2-3 days with medium usage. The sound quality it good too, if you are looking for high bass, then don't go for it. It doesn't hurt the ears after using it for long. Color is also cute. It's a good purchase in 1000/-, value for money.

Naveen  Kumar,3,Fair,Writing the review after using the product for 6 months.The quality of the product is good but only for listening to songs and videos. When you are on call the voice is not clear and it often breaks in between. So if you are buying it for making call it's not an apt product but if u are buying for listening songs just go for it

Flipkart Customer,2,Not good,"I'm pretty disappointed with these earphones as the sound quality is okay, but it defects very easily. I have these earphones for 5 months as I write this review and I already had to replace it 3 times because of faulty piece. It usually works for 20-30 days without any problem and then suddenly the left earpiece stops working. The only good thing about these is that it has a hassle free replacement policy under warranty. But it's useless if I have to visit the service center every 20-30 days..."

Manish  Kumar,5,Great product,"Excellent airbuds. I was a bit sceptical about the connectivity and battery issues. But fair to say, i was wrong. Can switch connection from one device to another while having the airbuds in your ears only. And talking about the battery, it just goes on and on and on. The quality of sound is also up to the mark.One slight issue which i found was when talking over calls... The voice sometimes echoes a bit(on the receiver's side).Overall a good purchase. Not to mention the brand tag as well, ..."
shantanu phatak,3,Decent product,Build quality is okay . Feels a bit plasticky. Charging case is a bit rattley and the led indicators are very annoying as they continue to glow till the buds are charged. Battery backup is awesome i easily get 10+ hours on full charge

The case is very handy and the size of the buds are accurate. 2.Buds are really comfortable and do not give pain to ears. I used it 3-4 hours straight. Faced no problem. 3. I used this for listening music, playing games and calling. The bass is quite pumpy yet balanced. I used this with Hey Melody app and experience was good. 4.

Rudra prasad Mishra,4,Delightful,Pros:-1-very loud which not only increases battery life but also makes listening great.2- Bass is punchy. I have used the previous enco buds. This has way better bass than its predecessor.3- Although bass is high it doesn't suppress the vocal. Overall sound is great in this price range.4- it provides modes for your choice of music in hey melody app which was not present in the enco buds.5- battery life is actually good. Probably lasts 6 to 7 hours.Cons:-1- Although design quality is...
Kanukula Venu,4,Wonderful,Battery 🔋 is ok but it so small case like a Oreo biscuit size so slippery But over all value for money the best sound quality the best bass on it Nise product fully satisfied with this product in this budget segment 👍
Anukumar K,2,Not good,"After a Youtuber review, i bought this. WASTE OF MONEYPros: Bass and Treble is good, Easy to Pair, Touch controls are good.

Rohan Kumar Parida,3,Does the job,Pros:- The sound is really good in the price range. It has a crisp and balanced sound. Also the look is very nice and with the case you can carry it in your pocket as well as it's not bulky. It's good for music lovers and gamers.Cons:- The mic quality is very poor. So it picks up background noise significantly during phone call. It also modifies the voice a bit which is received as a muffled voice at receiver's end. So you have to listen carefully to understand the words in office environme...

Flipkart Customer,4,Good quality product,"Highs and Bass is great but when compared to oppo enco m31  neckband, it misses sound clarity and mids are okish.Everything is great but to suit most of the indian public oppo is trying to change its signature sound and trying to be more like boat earphones.The sound stage is not like oppo enco m31, though enco m31 lacked the bass, but I liked it anyway."

Ishan B,1,Very poor,"To all the reviewers and bloggers saying this is best and all nonsense. This is just average. Bass is just too high and clarity is just like any other earphone. The case is too small so the in hand feel is bad. The inner portion is not white (as seen in pictures), it's a little bluish which again gives a cheap look. Rather opt for realme buds in this range."

Vaishak Suresh,5,Brilliant,"Great upgrade from the previous model on Oppo Enco buds which i used before buying this. I usually don't prefer earbuds with stem, but i found the stem of this one quite unnoticeable and comfortable. It has decent sound quality and a punchy bass. Especially if we chose bass mode by linking it with the Hey melody app. The only disappointed is that the ads showed that it has Dolby Atmos, but it actually doesn't have it, instead there are three options. One is original sound, then bass boosted a..."

Alli Khadga Jyoth,4,Good choice,"TLDR at the bottom 👍I liked it. The sound quality is good, I felt the bass is  balanced, but I didn't feel that umph in the very low bass. I wish it had dual connectivity, switching devices is a chore. For me the comfort was an issue, and I could not wear these for more than 1 or 2 hrs at a time, for you it might be different. The case is also compact and easily fits in pocket. One  nitpick is, since the case is all black and rounded, you will have to juggle the case to find the lid every t..."

Mahesh Chary,5,Brilliant,"I have boat 121, realme Techlife T100 and now oppo enco buds 2. I can say that this is far most superior in sound quality. Realme T100 comes close to this one and also delivers good quality sound. But Oppo is few steps ahead and what a bass. Very good product for bass lovers and for non bass lovers ss you can change it with the help of pre built equalizers.  Don't think. Just go and buy it. You won't regret and will thank me."
Aryan  Barik,5,Great product,Sounds like a perfect combination of deep bass and treble .loved the design. And it is user friendly .
Sreeshanth,3,Decent product,"The TWS is good, but the bass is a little too high.I've used both the Sennheiser CX180 and the Oppo Enco M31 Neckband, and both provide a very well-balanced, clear audio experience.That is the kind of sound I prefer. After reading the reviews on the Enco Buds 2, I was skeptical about the bass of the tws, but when I saw the price was around 1699, I couldn't resist ordering.The high bass makes prolonged use uncomfortable.It would be great if the HeyMelody app could support custom equalizer..."

Safeer A K,5,Perfect product!,"After 1 month use, I am saying this.... For less than 2k this earbud is worth it. Dolby surround is not 100%  there but you can feel it's presence.

Sanchit Gautam,5,Wonderful,"One of the best buds under 2k category. The bass and sound is incredible if you keep it till 75% volume (Since its output is generally loud and crisp, you might never go beyond 75% ). The call quality is average(decent, or best under 2k buds), it does catches the background noise but the listener over the call is able to hear out and understand the words correctly unlike others in the same category. The fitting on the ears is impeccable and gentle. Also, they do not hurt your ears even after ..."
praveen kumai,3,Fair,It is just ok. Not that great sounding earpod. However no regrets buying it as had bought it was compatible with my Oppo phone and would sound better but was not that incredible.

Durgesh  Kumar,4,Very Good,"1st thing i noticed after use about 1 hour that it has decent sound quality ,clear and loud music bass is not so punchy but you can feel 2nd it is quite comfort in my ear This is my second product which I experience in wireless earbuds, I have using truke buds S1 before oppo enco buds 2 and clearly saying that if you are a heavy bass lover then choose Truke buds S1 and if you are a music lover with clear mids and highs then you can definitely go with it.In my opinion I'll go with Truke bu..."
Aditya Mokashe,5,Just wow!,"Really gr8 at this price range , rather I would say best best at this price. I have used 2 to 3 earbuds below 2000 but this just hits different. It's sound and base is gr8 and the most imp, my calling experience was good with this one. Overall I'll say it is worth your money so don't hesitate 👍🏻"
PREMKUMAR SEEMA,5,Terrific,These earpods have good punchy bass. Music is really top notch.Call quality is pretty decent.I got these at 1700 in offer which is a pretty good deal.Earfit is just a bit not that comfortable. But it depends upon your ear shape as well.Overall good product
Madhu  Sudhan V,5,Highly recommended,Good one with good base but should have improved mic quality... If u think only for calling skip this.... If u are only focus is to listen songs and for movies and for moderate call usage go for it this is best one....
Jhuman Mukherjee,5,Brilliant,"There is no doubt that this is good in terms of ear comfort and sound. Boat users may find it very different in terms of clarity. Boat ear buds are a bit louder. This has 3 options for voice modulation, original sound, bass boosted and clear vocals so you have that choice. First time users would simply love the product. Very good for calls, podcasts and of course music. No second thought just plug and enjoy the beats."
Suresh Kumar R,4,Delightful,"I'm writing this review after 4days used Design: the design is neat and good the grip as well the size small and fit in pocket.Call quality: one of the best I'll say because i have tried several TWS for calling this one is the best with ENC is quite good call quality is awesome.Battery: we can use it for 2days and it took 1.30mins to charge the case.Bass: exact bass is good even we can modify smart mode, music and gaming Worth for money 💰💸 go for it use it"
Tharun Dyapa,5,Fabulous!,These buds are the best 💥. Proper balance between bass and treble. Perfectly fits in the ear even if you are running. You can use this for gym also. You can choose this buds under 2k.
prince bhattacharya,5,Awesome,Loved it ...Oppo done a great job by introducing this kind of earbuds in these price range ! 😌 fully satisfied
kunal pahuja,3,Just okay,"QualityBuds - The earbuds are VERY light, this can be good thing for comfort but they feel kinda cheap , they look decent but when you hold them in hand, they feel fake. But that's to be expected from the price i paid. Case - the shape is very stupid, all earbuds cases should be rectangular, it's the best shape to carry in the pocket , build quality is decent, hinge is firm , the matte finish On the case might not hold that much but that has to be seen. SoundThe sound is passable for..."
Sumanth Pothuganti,5,Super!,"pros:-buds will not come out from ear because this buds are perfectly fixes into ears. and suggested to use even in travelling-faster connection making-super sound quality-perfect base boosting, high deep music.-less weight.

Raja babu bhagat Adith,5,Great product,Very nice product value for money but i was expecting a charging cabel inside it but it was not their although the product was very good very good bass and spund i loved it im satisfied with the product
PRANESH KUMAR,3,Does the job,"Sound quality is just average, dont expect deep bass, its like not too good and not too bad. The product is not backed by good app support for IOS, so u cant adjust the equalizer. THE BUILD QUALITY IS AWESOME, i accidentally washed it in washing machine for full 2 hours and even after that its working perfectly fine .... :D"
Flipkart Customer,5,Brilliant,"to be honest I'm satisfied with the product.... Just fell that and trust me it's a good one and feel the base and the connectivity is good ,so just go for it....."
Ajay Biswas,3,Good,I have been using this tws for a week now the audio quality is good with good bass and the lows and highs are clear  but sadly it don't support Dolby Atmos as it is mentioned and the latency is average like other Tws  the build quality is really good it's very convenient to carry overall you can go for it 😁👍.P.s. purchase it during a sale.
S Bala Subramanian,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Fantastic buds I really enjoyed music mid high and bass very well balanced aswellas voice clarity is crystal clear in every song ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Deva Raj,4,Nice product,I think noise cancellation is not good .. and sound quality is good but who prefer for huge bass sound this is not good for   them.. overall is okay...
prafulla bhadane,2,Expected a better product,Sound quality is not excellent but it's ok . But in call recording app voice of other person can't record . Prefer better brand like boat etc .In lesse price you can get better product than oppo not worth to but 2/5 rating
Flipkart Customer,3,Good,"1 )It's doesn't have a deep Basse . 2)But it's good it has a lot of sound , like it3) But in just 3 days it got a lot of scratches so i don't like that4) And the sound is a bitt less resonant 5 this is my  personal  review for the product"
Prateem De,4,Nice product,"No doubt it's a good pick within this price bracket. Let's try to keep this review precise and to the point.1. Sound quality- Decent enough, not so premium and definitely you can't expect more within the price range it comes at. 2. Bass- Best choice for the bass lovers. Tuned in such a way to provide extra bass but still lacking in terms of punch. Sometimes it feels too much thumpy and loud and thus eats up the feel of the music.3. Touch- controls are convenient and work properly. Volum..."
AVINASH KUMAR,3,Decent product,"1. Sound quality worth in this price.2. Delay more than 30 sec in touch sensing.3. Sometimes touch sensing not working properly.4. Punchy , balanced sound.5. Dolby Atmos not working , it's like normal sound.6. Calling quality is good, microphone working fine. 7. It's little bulky but it's fit nicely in my ear. 8. It's good for jim or jogging."
Bharath Kumar ,2,Could be way better,"Iam using these buds it was good by looks and design, build quality but the sound quality is not that much expected the issue iam facing with these buds. I can hear outside noise clearly while you using these buds you have to increase to the full volume to ignore your surrounding noise.I definitely I will not recommend this buds for this price you have to look another best options in my opinion these buds are not value for money. Sound quality is the first and foremost priority no matte..."

The earphones and the case looks very nice with the matte finish. Coming to sound quality the earphones are quite loud and have a great bass, you can feel the Dolby Atmos experience. The touch to control could be a little tricky at times but it's just the first day hopefully I'll get used to it. Connectivity is on point no ..."

But the call quality of realme buds q2 was very bad. So I purchased these  for calls and it was decent. No one complained about my voice quality.Options were little less. But the sound quality is greatVocals and mids are good. Volume is huge and bass is little low but I could sense the surround effects due to Dolby Atmos support. Overall am satisfied with oppo

Biswojit Kar,1,Worthless,Case build quality is too bad. Got scratches in a day.AI Deep Noise Cancellation is just a gimmick and it doesn't isolate noise at all during calls.Flipkart will never take the product back even if its technician doesn't able to prove the AI deep noise cancellation features of the ear buds Don't buy if you are interested to buy for AI Deep Noise Cancellation feature. I wasted my money as I thought these ear buds will help in clear calls unlike  the JBL120TWS buds I have. And felt cheated.

Mohit Vasisth,3,Nice,Ok product as per price. Sound is ok as I have used one plus bullets for a long time so my heart does not admire it's sound quality but if you want a good noise  cancellation and more bass then use larger eartips ( atleast works for me) and for a good sound quality use smaller tips . It's touch sensor is so much sensitive that it senses the unintensive touches. overall an average product. For entry level or at this price point can be considered.

Rudra prasad Mishra,4,Delightful,Pros:-1-very loud which not only increases battery life but also makes listening great.2- Bass is punchy. I have used the previous enco buds. This has way better bass than its predecessor.3- Although bass is high it doesn't suppress the vocal. Overall sound is great in this price range.4- it provides modes for your choice of music in hey melody app which was not present in the enco buds.5- battery life is actually good. Probably lasts 6 to 7 hours.Cons:-1- Although design quality is...

Rohan Kumar Parida,3,Does the job,Pros:- The sound is really good in the price range. It has a crisp and balanced sound. Also the look is very nice and with the case you can carry it in your pocket as well as it's not bulky. It's good for music lovers and gamers.Cons:- The mic quality is very poor. So it picks up background noise significantly during phone call. It also modifies the voice a bit which is received as a muffled voice at receiver's end. So you have to listen carefully to understand the words in office environme...

Flipkart Customer,4,Good quality product,"Highs and Bass is great but when compared to oppo enco m31  neckband, it misses sound clarity and mids are okish.Everything is great but to suit most of the indian public oppo is trying to change its signature sound and trying to be more like boat earphones.The sound stage is not like oppo enco m31, though enco m31 lacked the bass, but I liked it anyway."

Ishan B,1,Very poor,"To all the reviewers and bloggers saying this is best and all nonsense. This is just average. Bass is just too high and clarity is just like any other earphone. The case is too small so the in hand feel is bad. The inner portion is not white (as seen in pictures), it's a little bluish which again gives a cheap look. Rather opt for realme buds in this range."

Vaishak Suresh,5,Brilliant,"Great upgrade from the previous model on Oppo Enco buds which i used before buying this. I usually don't prefer earbuds with stem, but i found the stem of this one quite unnoticeable and comfortable. It has decent sound quality and a punchy bass. Especially if we chose bass mode by linking it with the Hey melody app. The only disappointed is that the ads showed that it has Dolby Atmos, but it actually doesn't have it, instead there are three options. One is original sound, then bass boosted a..."

Alli Khadga Jyoth,4,Good choice,"TLDR at the bottom 👍I liked it. The sound quality is good, I felt the bass is  balanced, but I didn't feel that umph in the very low bass. I wish it had dual connectivity, switching devices is a chore. For me the comfort was an issue, and I could not wear these for more than 1 or 2 hrs at a time, for you it might be different. The case is also compact and easily fits in pocket. One  nitpick is, since the case is all black and rounded, you will have to juggle the case to find the lid every t..."

Mahesh Chary,5,Brilliant,"I have boat 121, realme Techlife T100 and now oppo enco buds 2. I can say that this is far most superior in sound quality. Realme T100 comes close to this one and also delivers good quality sound. But Oppo is few steps ahead and what a bass. Very good product for bass lovers and for non bass lovers ss you can change it with the help of pre built equalizers.  Don't think. Just go and buy it. You won't regret and will thank me."

Sreeshanth,3,Decent product,"The TWS is good, but the bass is a little too high.I've used both the Sennheiser CX180 and the Oppo Enco M31 Neckband, and both provide a very well-balanced, clear audio experience.That is the kind of sound I prefer. After reading the reviews on the Enco Buds 2, I was skeptical about the bass of the tws, but when I saw the price was around 1699, I couldn't resist ordering.The high bass makes prolonged use uncomfortable.It would be great if the HeyMelody app could support custom equalizer..."

Sanchit Gautam,5,Wonderful,"One of the best buds under 2k category. The bass and sound is incredible if you keep it till 75% volume (Since its output is generally loud and crisp, you might never go beyond 75% ). The call quality is average(decent, or best under 2k buds), it does catches the background noise but the listener over the call is able to hear out and understand the words correctly unlike others in the same category. The fitting on the ears is impeccable and gentle. Also, they do not hurt your ears even after ..."

praveen kumai,3,Fair,It is just ok. Not that great sounding earpod. However no regrets buying it as had bought it was compatible with my Oppo phone and would sound better but was not that incredible.

Durgesh  Kumar,4,Very Good,"1st thing i noticed after use about 1 hour that it has decent sound quality ,clear and loud music bass is not so punchy but you can feel 2nd it is quite comfort in my ear This is my second product which I experience in wireless earbuds, I have using truke buds S1 before oppo enco buds 2 and clearly saying that if you are a heavy bass lover then choose Truke buds S1 and if you are a music lover with clear mids and highs then you can definitely go with it.In my opinion I'll go with Truke bu..."
Aditya Mokashe,5,Just wow!,"Really gr8 at this price range , rather I would say best best at this price. I have used 2 to 3 earbuds below 2000 but this just hits different. It's sound and base is gr8 and the most imp, my calling experience was good with this one. Overall I'll say it is worth your money so don't hesitate 👍🏻"
PREMKUMAR SEEMA,5,Terrific,These earpods have good punchy bass. Music is really top notch.Call quality is pretty decent.I got these at 1700 in offer which is a pretty good deal.Earfit is just a bit not that comfortable. But it depends upon your ear shape as well.Overall good product
Madhu  Sudhan V,5,Highly recommended,Good one with good base but should have improved mic quality... If u think only for calling skip this.... If u are only focus is to listen songs and for movies and for moderate call usage go for it this is best one....
Jhuman Mukherjee,5,Brilliant,"There is no doubt that this is good in terms of ear comfort and sound. Boat users may find it very different in terms of clarity. Boat ear buds are a bit louder. This has 3 options for voice modulation, original sound, bass boosted and clear vocals so you have that choice. First time users would simply love the product. Very good for calls, podcasts and of course music. No second thought just plug and enjoy the beats."
Suresh Kumar R,4,Delightful,"I'm writing this review after 4days used Design: the design is neat and good the grip as well the size small and fit in pocket.Call quality: one of the best I'll say because i have tried several TWS for calling this one is the best with ENC is quite good call quality is awesome.Battery: we can use it for 2days and it took 1.30mins to charge the case.Bass: exact bass is good even we can modify smart mode, music and gaming Worth for money 💰💸 go for it use it"
Tharun Dyapa,5,Fabulous!,These buds are the best 💥. Proper balance between bass and treble. Perfectly fits in the ear even if you are running. You can use this for gym also. You can choose this buds under 2k.
prince bhattacharya,5,Awesome,Loved it ...Oppo done a great job by introducing this kind of earbuds in these price range ! 😌 fully satisfied
kunal pahuja,3,Just okay,"QualityBuds - The earbuds are VERY light, this can be good thing for comfort but they feel kinda cheap , they look decent but when you hold them in hand, they feel fake. But that's to be expected from the price i paid. Case - the shape is very stupid, all earbuds cases should be rectangular, it's the best shape to carry in the pocket , build quality is decent, hinge is firm , the matte finish On the case might not hold that much but that has to be seen. SoundThe sound is passable for..."
Sumanth Pothuganti,5,Super!,"pros:-buds will not come out from ear because this buds are perfectly fixes into ears. and suggested to use even in travelling-faster connection making-super sound quality-perfect base boosting, high deep music.-less weight.

Raja babu bhagat Adith,5,Great product,Very nice product value for money but i was expecting a charging cabel inside it but it was not their although the product was very good very good bass and spund i loved it im satisfied with the product
PRANESH KUMAR,3,Does the job,"Sound quality is just average, dont expect deep bass, its like not too good and not too bad. The product is not backed by good app support for IOS, so u cant adjust the equalizer. THE BUILD QUALITY IS AWESOME, i accidentally washed it in washing machine for full 2 hours and even after that its working perfectly fine .... :D"
Flipkart Customer,5,Brilliant,"to be honest I'm satisfied with the product.... Just fell that and trust me it's a good one and feel the base and the connectivity is good ,so just go for it....."
Ajay Biswas,3,Good,I have been using this tws for a week now the audio quality is good with good bass and the lows and highs are clear  but sadly it don't support Dolby Atmos as it is mentioned and the latency is average like other Tws  the build quality is really good it's very convenient to carry overall you can go for it 😁👍.P.s. purchase it during a sale.
S Bala Subramanian,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Fantastic buds I really enjoyed music mid high and bass very well balanced aswellas voice clarity is crystal clear in every song ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Deva Raj,4,Nice product,I think noise cancellation is not good .. and sound quality is good but who prefer for huge bass sound this is not good for   them.. overall is okay...
prafulla bhadane,2,Expected a better product,Sound quality is not excellent but it's ok . But in call recording app voice of other person can't record . Prefer better brand like boat etc .In lesse price you can get better product than oppo not worth to but 2/5 rating
Flipkart Customer,3,Good,"1 )It's doesn't have a deep Basse . 2)But it's good it has a lot of sound , like it3) But in just 3 days it got a lot of scratches so i don't like that4) And the sound is a bitt less resonant 5 this is my  personal  review for the product"
Prateem De,4,Nice product,"No doubt it's a good pick within this price bracket. Let's try to keep this review precise and to the point.1. Sound quality- Decent enough, not so premium and definitely you can't expect more within the price range it comes at. 2. Bass- Best choice for the bass lovers. Tuned in such a way to provide extra bass but still lacking in terms of punch. Sometimes it feels too much thumpy and loud and thus eats up the feel of the music.3. Touch- controls are convenient and work properly. Volum..."
AVINASH KUMAR,3,Decent product,"1. Sound quality worth in this price.2. Delay more than 30 sec in touch sensing.3. Sometimes touch sensing not working properly.4. Punchy , balanced sound.5. Dolby Atmos not working , it's like normal sound.6. Calling quality is good, microphone working fine. 7. It's little bulky but it's fit nicely in my ear. 8. It's good for jim or jogging."
Bharath Kumar ,2,Could be way better,"Iam using these buds it was good by looks and design, build quality but the sound quality is not that much expected the issue iam facing with these buds. I can hear outside noise clearly while you using these buds you have to increase to the full volume to ignore your surrounding noise.I definitely I will not recommend this buds for this price you have to look another best options in my opinion these buds are not value for money. Sound quality is the first and foremost priority no matte..."

Yash More,5,Must buy!,"Purchased the product on the 1st day itself for Rs.1799. Received the product today (2 days later)My initial impression on the product, the packaging is minimal and good. The earphones and the case looks very nice with the matte finish. Coming to sound quality the earphones are quite loud and have a great bass, you can feel the Dolby Atmos experience. The touch to control could be a little tricky at times but it's just the first day hopefully I'll get used to it. Connectivity is on point no ..."

Anjan  Sai,4,Good choice,I was little sceptical over buying these. Since I have already been using realme buds q2 over an year which are still working. But the call quality of realme buds q2 was very bad. So I purchased these  for calls and it was decent. No one complained about my voice quality.Options were little less. But the sound quality is greatVocals and mids are good. Volume is huge and bass is little low but I could sense the surround effects due to Dolby Atmos support. Overall am satisfied with oppo

Biswojit Kar,1,Worthless,Case build quality is too bad. Got scratches in a day.AI Deep Noise Cancellation is just a gimmick and it doesn't isolate noise at all during calls.Flipkart will never take the product back even if its technician doesn't able to prove the AI deep noise cancellation features of the ear buds Don't buy if you are interested to buy for AI Deep Noise Cancellation feature. I wasted my money as I thought these ear buds will help in clear calls unlike  the JBL120TWS buds I have. And felt cheated.

Sreehari Raghu,4,Wonderful,Got it within 48 hours of ordering👌. This is a value for money product to be precise. Built quality and look is good. Bass comes up pretty good and sound quality and clarity is also decent. App support is also good. Low latency while playing games like pubg and asphalt 9. For me this is the best in this price range. If you can afford for more than 2500 inr (as of feb 2023) there are better options as per your needs.I'll update on the battery after a week's usage.
Sandip  Kunder,5,Terrific purchase,"I got it for my girl in valentines .What i heard from her and i felt was these earphones are a great choice for anyone who values sound quality, call clarity, and style.

The sleek, modern design is both functional and stylish, and the earbuds fit comfortably and securely in the ear. Overall, a great option for anyone looking for high-quality earphones."

Joshua Stephen Roy,4,Good choice,After 1week of use.Sound quality and bass are awsome. I recommend not to use more than 70% sound it will  cause pain for you ears because such a loud and deep bass sound in more than 75% sound quality. First 2 days earbud are a bit tight for my ear and cause pain but after that it is nice to use. Battery backup for earbud is satisfactory and it took 10 minites for 10% of charge. Charging time for earbud took less 1.5hours but for case i got 20-24 hours backup bit the company promises 28 hour...

Not good for calling purpose which I think is the prime reason why people buy wireless earphones.3. For audiophiles- keep your expectations down. Also bass is quite low, not for bass lovers at all.4. Sound loudness dropped a bit after 1 week of usage. 5. Hinge is really weak. And I'm pretty sure it will get weaker over the time. 6. Flipkart return policies has hit the bottom. So start thinking twice..."

Instrument separation is at its best, the bass punchy not overpowering, and vocals can be heard crystal clear. I was surprised how can a brand like Oppo which is good for mobiles gives such good audio at a reasonable price. Don't waste time searching, if you have good taste in music you should ..."

I have used oppo M31 for 2 years and was a very satisfied customer of oppo.... But this product is not as expected from oppo , especially regarding the vocals. It's somewhat like that of the boat earbuds . tThose who want it for clear vocals and use earbuds for a longer duration are not for them. My ears started to hurt..."

Pratik Rathod,5,Awesome,The bass mode is surprisingly good. It doesn't interfere too much with the mids and the highs. does its job. I use it when i'm outside. For further tuning i just use my system equaliser to match the overall sound to my liking. takes one setup and then you can enjoy it then on.Call quality isn't great but you can take calls when there's not much background noise.The earbuds are comfortable. I just use the default buds.

Rishikesh Kumar,5,Terrific,"The best pair of TWS in the 2000 budget segment as of September 2022. Oppo's sound and bass quality is surely above par the competition. The TWS are quite loud, I usually listen at 40-50% of the volume at most times and it is still enough in most conditions. The only lacking feature I feel it has is the missing battery percentage for its charging case because there is no way you can check that, until the case runs out of battery totally. Its not in the app, and not on the case itself."

Tushar Keshla,5,Awesome,"According to the budget, it is worth buying. 1) Sound quality is good but not very good.2) Touch works fine, but doesn't distinguish between human touch or any other thing.. It responds even if u are wearing gloves which is good in most of the cases. 3) battery backup is good. Buds last for 1.5-2hrs and whole case backup is almost 10-11 hrs... So in a single case charge, u can charge the buds 3-4 times.. In the end, I would say it is amazing in such an affordable price"

If you listen to music in high volume then battery will drain fast and only lasts for 1.5 to 2 hrs. After use of 9 months it became worse . Battery life is now only 2hr with every plug-in charge . Case is not holding any charge . Right ear piece stopped working . Always telling low battery
