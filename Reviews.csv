Jasmeet Singh,4,Good choice,"Benefits :- cheap, fits properly in ur ear, sound quality is better, battery backup is good, good design.

I conside it to be purchased."

Alham  Noor,1,Don't waste your money,"First of all decent design but...tbh sound quality is not so decent as I was expecting way better it's only ""thump"" in the sound , calling is okay ,touch controls are pretty impressive battery backup is quite good but still the issue remains sound quality is not good"

Flipkart Customer,2,Moderate,Songs wise listening is good experience but call experience is very poor call gets disconnected if u accidentally touch earphones also battery backup is not good instead if u go for wired Bluetooth earphone they have great battery backup also design nd build wise while u r outdoors it's quite difficult to take calls and u have to speak loudly!Not worth buying instead go for wired earphones!

Rinshu Raj,4,Value-for-money,"My structure review after using it for more than 10 days:- Not for gaming stuffs.- sound quality is good.- Bass is good but not too good.- Design and build is top notch.- Touch is working fine.If you are someone who just want to do your work like studying, listening music in free time then just go for this product. It is very good in that sense but if you're thinking to buy this for gaming and stuff then this one is not a best option."

Charging capacity is good, it sustains for a longer duration and gets charged instantly. Left & Right, both the Buds syncs fast.Using it with Apple devices, bring the best of it. The finger tap feature is also of great help. Switching between Apple Devices is very easy and fast.It detects ear-presence and your device behaves accordingly.Good point, that it can be used anywhere,..."
Mohammed Naved,5,Just wow!,"Sound quality is good moreover voice calling is also available but sometimes it doesn't works properly...overall it's good, as a matter of fact I bought it for 899 and what else you expect in this price range?"

Abhishek Kannan,5,Worth every penny,"To be honest before i ordered these i had no expectations. But when i got them and on the first try it blew my mind. Seriously it's really good for this amount of price.PROS :-~ good sound~ decent bass~ comfortable fit~ value for moneyCONS:-~ too glossy, gets scratches fast (from my pov)~ only one led indicator on the case."
Litton Behera,5,Simply awesome,"I have been using this ear buds since 9 th January 2023 .its so easy to use and connect with smartphone and the main features about product this is that I must have to is noise cancellation it's amazing, you can believe my experience,that if I will tell you when I  put this on ear the surrounding goes silent no noises are there I totally impressed with this product . obviously i recomment to buy this . it's amazing üòç"
Flipkart Customer,4,Wonderful,"Got it for 799 during big billion days sales. It's definitely worth the amount paid. Coming to sound quality, it lacks that balanced sound output. Bass totally overshadows and miss vocal clarity and high frequency most of the times. Bass heads might like it. Touch controls works well. Call clarity is average. Overall a good deal."
Achint Rout,3,Does the job,I am giving this review after using 1 month. Battery back up is superb of both buds and casing. Sound is good in the price. If you are purchasing for calling purpose only then don't buy. Straight range is good and connectivity but down ward or upward range is very less. But for 1st use you can go for it. Worth of money.
Washim  Sajjad,4,Worth the money,"The functionality is pretty decent. All the specified touch responses are functioning properly. But, one should not except refined sound quality. It has a balance sound quality. I am happy with this headphone."

Ritesh Arlikatti,1,Not recommended at all,"This product could have been way better if not for the sensitive touch feqrure. I mean even when you adjust the buds in your ears, either the volume increases or the songs keep skipping or something else happens. It's annoying to say the least. They could have at least given the option of disabling the touch options completely. It's only because of the sensitive touch I'm not able to use these buds at all. Can't even return"

Mukesh  sharma,4,Wonderful,Good
Sumiran Dewan,4,Very Good,"For a non tech savvy person like me it is a simple enough product that does it's job. Music sounds fine enough but call is not very clear. For a person like me who only uses earphones for 1-2 hours a day, the case needs charging only around twice a week. Colour is more like baby blue. Case material feels like cheap plastic but for the price paid it's acceptable. Touch function is highly sensitive and even a slight movement of your hair might change/pause the music or raise/ lower the volume."

Nidhin M,3,Good,Overall good product but the design is the main issue.It is too big so we cant feel the real sound of it because of the size of this product. i buyed it for 650 rupees and it is my first tws. in this price range im oke with that. no latency issues. But if you going to buy any tws consider its size because of if it is too big or too small you dont get the feel that you want in using that product the sound got distracted in your ear you feel its like a closed room sound. Frankly im not satisfi...

Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...Just go for it"
Divyanshu Singh,5,Great product,Satisfying . Received today morning. Continuously using this earpods for 3 hrs and still battery is at 90% . So all good. Base can be better but good at this price. Good at calling also. I can hear voice while riding and that's really good. Overall worth buying.
Pratik Trivedi,4,Nice product,"Very good option at this pricePros: Build quality, clear sound, Lightweight, branded product at low price, perfect fitting, insta wake up technology Good bass and sound(by using other music players mentioned below) Cons: Low bass which can control by other music players like Google play music, Dub music player or third party equaliser app. You will get perfect sound by playing music on this players."
Kumar Gaurav,5,Great product,"Everything is fine, just need improve the bass, and one thing many users have said does not work one side, tell them u reset once  and then both will work, the battery is very good and excellent performance but many people will have a slight pain in the ear while using it first time, but will not do it when they get used to it after a few days, in the last I will just say that u will not get any good from it at such a low price,  THANKS boAt INDIA & THANKS Flipkartüòçüòç"

Dhruv Shah,3,Nice,OkUpdated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.
Prashant  Kalebag,4,Worth the money,Bass is not upto the mark. Sound quality is excellent. Cryastal clear sound. Boat should improve the bass quality in this airdopes. Boats other headphones having best bass .overall it's good and value for money.
Rushabh Chandra,4,Wonderful,Thank you flipkart for the fastest delivery got this airdopes delivered within 24 hrs ....

Flipkart Customer,1,Worst experience ever!,"Not at all for bass lover. The music just seems to be soft nor is it loud, there's no loudness at all. According to the price it should've been a bit more worth it building up the bass & for bass lovers there's no bass at all. Giving an honest review from the day of purchase & delivered."

Malay Pandey,5,Just wow!,"It is definitely a good purchase at this price, those who don't care for loud bass and thing, they can go for this, these Airdopes are perfectly balanced in terms of sound, the sound doesn't breaks at high volumes, you can still enjoy your songs smoothly. The normal calling with this works perfectly, no as such issues there, but you may find bit issues on WhatsApp calls, as voice tends to break sometimes.

Jai Chhatpar,4,Value-for-money,"The earphone got delivered in 1 day. Speaking of sound quality the sound is good you get decent amount of base for the price. The design though is not upto the mark you cannot wear it for prolonged hours as it gets uncomfortable. The microphone is ok calling experience is ok not that great. Battery backups i cannot comment on that as I haven‚Äôt used it a lot. But for the price that you are paying ,this thing is totally worth the buy."
Aditya Singh,5,Just wow!,Best product but bass is less battery is also best design is also best and sound quality is also best but bass is less
Ankur Govil,5,Fabulous!,"It's nice overall mainly because of the low price. It has pressable button towards the outer part by pressing which one can receive/reject call, play/pause music. The bass is not upto the mark. Call quality is nice. But what else you need for such low cost. Good for those who don't like in-ear silicone earphones."
Sandeep Mishra,5,Must buy!,"So actually these are very impressive at such low price. Boat has been always knows for delivering great sound. Its just the product quality should have been a bit more high because it will get scratches on the go.. One thing is that you cannot hold it for longer as the ear start paining. short duration is ok to use. I already owe One plus z buds , those are really very comfy.

This is better than Boult Tws Freepods in mic quality. Calling Mic is good but if you turn on Fan, it will sound like talking inside water. Mic quality of Boat 402 is better.

This thing I really like.I don't like it design as it kept on falling from ears it kind of frustrating. If you are thinking to buy this for gym workout or running it not suitable.

Thiyagarajan Ramachandran,4,Pretty good,"All are excellent but it is not connected well with Microsoft Teams call because in other end can't hear properly, so unable to use it for official call.

Additionally, it won't block your ear hole fully so you'll get enough ventilation for your ear which eliminate ear problems."

Harbir Waan,3,Decent product,"I wish to point out one very basic thing the earbuds are designed well but the material used for covering the sound outlet is no good it in good brands its steel or metal based very fine mesh, in this case it  just came out to be nothing but a cloth based thin layer pasted with low quality glue. Not a good experience. Earbud without this cover is firstly exposed and not so appealing anymore."

Kritika Chauhan,5,Simply awesome,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it. 3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look."

Pankaj Panjwani,5,Just wow!,"I have been using Boat products since it was launched. I can vouch for their quality and durability. I am still using Boat Rockers 400 which is now almost 3 years old. Now coming to the product, they are very lightweight and handy, no need to power on and off just remove from box and voila they get connected to the phone. I have read some reviews here wherein people have complained that the bass is less. Please I get guarantee you that Bass is one of the best in all Boat devices including t..."
karthik,4,Very Good,"After 10 days of usage:*Bass is not that great, however fantastic considering price range*Battery holds for 5 - 6 hrs with pods and the charging case has ample amt of reserve battery of upto 35-40 hrs*Would be uncomfortable and painful for persons with small ears, as the material is plastic*Insta wake and pair feature is great and convenient*BT range is good to*Overall for the pricing of 700-800, a great buy, go for it"
Flipkart Customer,5,Terrific purchase,"Durable ,pwerfull,worth cost and awesome sound quality ...but somewhere 13mm base boost drivers are slightly low ...but its ok...bass is not that much low but also not that much thumps into our ears...overall gives us a precise and quality sound..."
Subhajyoti Sarkar,5,Just wow!,"I like this, I‚Äôm not that expert who understands sound quality well, it serves my purpose like YouTube movies, music, phone call everything were good, so for me it‚Äôs a good product."
Bhuwan Ghosh,5,Highly recommended,Excellent product under such a tight budget...Overall great experience till nowHowever the left earphone gets discharged earlier everytime than the right one even if I overcharge the left one separately or in pairGives a continuous playback of 3.5 hrs microphone is also awesome5 star for the product
Ajay Kumar,2,Bad quality,In this price range it's okay to buy this..but nothing great about this product...sound quality is okay types...voice clarity is not so good.the other person will always complaint that your voice is not coming clear...I purchased it for office use as I get many calls but this airdope does not suffice my need...
Arif Shaikh,5,Great product,Awesome product at very affordable great price. Very good and fine quality of sound for music and calls.Mic reception during calls is little weak in outdoor noisy places but works fine at indoor places.Great deal on Flipkart at budget cost. Fast delivery and quality of service by Flipkart.Unbelievable product at this price. A must have product.
NIKAY BESA Konyak,3,Does the job,"Review after 5 months:  Not good for calling. It doesn't receive voice properly and the listener doesn't hear well. It pains my ear as the buds are too big...Sound wise, it's good for listening music. Battery quality is good. Very easy and convenient to use."
Pranesh Rajkumar,4,Really Nice,Great in terms of the build and fitment. Instantly pairs with the last paired device and this is just great. Helps when you get a call and need to answer it immediately. Fits the ear perfectly and doesn‚Äôt fall out when walking or running.One shortcoming would be the bass - this is almost like null! For a WFH scenario perfect companion!

Manu Sanghi,5,Terrific,"I would rate this Boat model airdopes as best in this price range. Sharing the review post using it for couple of months- - Would rate sound quality as very good. Wouldn't say it's excellent, but it's much better than that of other products in this price bracket- Battery back up and fitment in the ear is also pretty good- Stylish and sleek look- Haven't used too much for calling...Have taken few audio calls on it.

UGav,5,Perfect product!,"Amazing airpods, just perfect for this price and excellent value for money. all types of sounds bass, treble are perfect and the sound quality, bluetooth connection are all perfectly well balanced."
Rajath Gopinath,5,Classy product,"Sound clarity is really awesome and there could be very few songs which you may be able to hear in full volume. The quality of the case(airdope charger)seems slightly inferior. Overall great value for money. Since I have just purchased the product, will not be able to comment on battery backup and recharging convenience."
Saumik Bhattacharjee,3,Does the job,"Pros: 1. Premium look2. Comparatively cheap3. Good battery backupCons:1. Design is such, that initially it will make your ears pain2. After few months connectivity will slow down3. Charging of the one ear bud stopped after 4-5 monthsOverall one can give this product a try, but there is no guarantee that the unit purchased will last long without any fault. Not very satisfied with the product."
Praneeth CHAKKIRALA ,4,Delightful,Best for the price. Audio quality can be improved. Battery backup is better than expected. Overall I am satisfied. In this price I shouldn't expect much. Using from 6mnths. Noice cancellation can be improved a lot..

Bipasha Chakraborty ,5,Simply awesome,"Let's talk about battery backup first... It stay charged for 2-3 days with medium usage. The sound quality it good too, if you are looking for high bass, then don't go for it. It doesn't hurt the ears after using it for long. Color is also cute. It's a good purchase in 1000/-, value for money. Sometimes after connecting it to the phone's Bluetooth, only one ear piece works, in that case you need to put both the ear pieces back into the holder, close the lid, wait for few seconds and conn..."

Not to mention the brand tag as well, ..."

PREMKUMAR SEEMA,5,Terrific,These earpods have good punchy bass. Music is really top notch.Call quality is pretty decent.I got these at 1700 in offer which is a pretty good deal.Earfit is just a bit not that comfortable. But it depends upon your ear shape as well.Overall good product
Madhu  Sudhan V,5,Highly recommended,Good one with good base but should have improved mic quality... If u think only for calling skip this.... If u are only focus is to listen songs and for movies and for moderate call usage go for it this is best one....
Jhuman Mukherjee,5,Brilliant,"There is no doubt that this is good in terms of ear comfort and sound. Boat users may find it very different in terms of clarity. Boat ear buds are a bit louder. This has 3 options for voice modulation, original sound, bass boosted and clear vocals so you have that choice. First time users would simply love the product. Very good for calls, podcasts and of course music. No second thought just plug and enjoy the beats."
Suresh Kumar R,4,Delightful,"I'm writing this review after 4days used Design: the design is neat and good the grip as well the size small and fit in pocket.Call quality: one of the best I'll say because i have tried several TWS for calling this one is the best with ENC is quite good call quality is awesome.Battery: we can use it for 2days and it took 1.30mins to charge the case.Bass: exact bass is good even we can modify smart mode, music and gaming Worth for money üí∞üí∏ go for it use it"
Tharun Dyapa,5,Fabulous!,These buds are the best üí•. Proper balance between bass and treble. Perfectly fits in the ear even if you are running. You can use this for gym also. You can choose this buds under 2k.

kunal pahuja,3,Just okay,"QualityBuds - The earbuds are VERY light, this can be good thing for comfort but they feel kinda cheap , they look decent but when you hold them in hand, they feel fake. But that's to be expected from the price i paid. Case - the shape is very stupid, all earbuds cases should be rectangular, it's the best shape to carry in the pocket , build quality is decent, hinge is firm , the matte finish On the case might not hold that much but that has to be seen.

PRANESH KUMAR,3,Does the job,"Sound quality is just average, dont expect deep bass, its like not too good and not too bad. The product is not backed by good app support for IOS, so u cant adjust the equalizer.

Flipkart Customer,5,Brilliant,"to be honest I'm satisfied with the product.... Just fell that and trust me it's a good one and feel the base and the connectivity is good ,so just go for it....."
Ajay Biswas,3,Good,I have been using this tws for a week now the audio quality is good with good bass and the lows and highs are clear  but sadly it don't support Dolby Atmos as it is mentioned and the latency is average like other Tws  the build quality is really good it's very convenient to carry overall you can go for it üòÅüëç.P.s. purchase it during a sale.

Prateem De,4,Nice product,"No doubt it's a good pick within this price bracket. Let's try to keep this review precise and to the point.1. Sound quality- Decent enough, not so premium and definitely you can't expect more within the price range it comes at. 2. Bass- Best choice for the bass lovers. Tuned in such a way to provide extra bass but still lacking in terms of punch. Sometimes it feels too much thumpy and loud and thus eats up the feel of the music.3. Touch- controls are convenient and work properly. Volum..."
AVINASH KUMAR,3,Decent product,"1. Sound quality worth in this price.2. Delay more than 30 sec in touch sensing.3. Sometimes touch sensing not working properly.4. Punchy , balanced sound.5. Dolby Atmos not working , it's like normal sound.6. Calling quality is good, microphone working fine. 7. It's little bulky but it's fit nicely in my ear. 8. It's good for jim or jogging."
Bharath Kumar ,2,Could be way better,"Iam using these buds it was good by looks and design, build quality but the sound quality is not that much expected the issue iam facing with these buds. I can hear outside noise clearly while you using these buds you have to increase to the full volume to ignore your surrounding noise.I definitely I will not recommend this buds for this price you have to look another best options in my opinion these buds are not value for money.

Sound is ok as I have used one plus bullets for a long time so my heart does not admire it's sound quality but if you want a good noise  cancellation and more bass then use larger eartips ( atleast works for me) and for a good sound quality use smaller tips . It's touch sensor is so much sensitive that it senses the unintensive touches. overall an average product. For entry level or at this price point can be considered.

Gaurav Singh,5,Terrific purchase,Value for money üí∞ but range should be at least  50 m.Nice and portable üëÇplugs. Mate Color. Good battery backup. Soulful sounding and bass.
Raghavendra Reddy,5,Fabulous!,It's very nice product i have used noise before this that has cost me around 4k but it's not worth it but this dam buds are very nice I'm loving it
Safeer A K,5,Perfect product!,"After 1 month use, I am saying this.... For less than 2k this earbud is worth it. Dolby surround is not 100%  there but you can feel it's presence. It's doesn't have active noise cancellation but passive voice cancellation does it's job flawlessly... Battery backup is great üëçüòÉ Overall a wonderful purchase. Thank you."
Udhaya Kumar,5,Wonderful,Amazing buds. Really I like it. Sound quality is too amazing. Bass sound is blast. Battery backup is also very good. Totally worth of cost. Don't miss it this amazing buds to buy. Thanks oppo giving this amazing buds to the world.

Sanchit Gautam,5,Wonderful,"One of the best buds under 2k category. The bass and sound is incredible if you keep it till 75% volume (Since its output is generally loud and crisp, you might never go beyond 75% ). The call quality is average(decent, or best under 2k buds), it does catches the background noise but the listener over the call is able to hear out and understand the words correctly unlike others in the same category. The fitting on the ears is impeccable and gentle. Also, they do not hurt your ears even after ..."
Sukamal  Bera,5,Simply awesome,This oppo ear two pro is one of the best products in its price range. And its sound quality is very nice and its call quality is also good and its billet quality is also very good so I just want to say that this product is super value for money.
praveen kumai,3,Fair,It is just ok. Not that great sounding earpod. However no regrets buying it as had bought it was compatible with my Oppo phone and would sound better but was not that incredible. Boult Y1 is much better that this one and is even cheaper that this one. Sorry Oppo this is my honest review for those who wants to buy this earpod.

PREMKUMAR SEEMA,5,Terrific,These earpods have good punchy bass. Music is really top notch.Call quality is pretty decent.I got these at 1700 in offer which is a pretty good deal.Earfit is just a bit not that comfortable. But it depends upon your ear shape as well.Overall good product
Madhu  Sudhan V,5,Highly recommended,Good one with good base but should have improved mic quality... If u think only for calling skip this.... If u are only focus is to listen songs and for movies and for moderate call usage go for it this is best one....
Jhuman Mukherjee,5,Brilliant,"There is no doubt that this is good in terms of ear comfort and sound. Boat users may find it very different in terms of clarity. Boat ear buds are a bit louder. This has 3 options for voice modulation, original sound, bass boosted and clear vocals so you have that choice. First time users would simply love the product. Very good for calls, podcasts and of course music. No second thought just plug and enjoy the beats."
Suresh Kumar R,4,Delightful,"I'm writing this review after 4days used Design: the design is neat and good the grip as well the size small and fit in pocket.Call quality: one of the best I'll say because i have tried several TWS for calling this one is the best with ENC is quite good call quality is awesome.Battery: we can use it for 2days and it took 1.30mins to charge the case.Bass: exact bass is good even we can modify smart mode, music and gaming Worth for money üí∞üí∏ go for it use it"

Prateem De,4,Nice product,"No doubt it's a good pick within this price bracket. Let's try to keep this review precise and to the point.1. Sound quality- Decent enough, not so premium and definitely you can't expect more within the price range it comes at. 2. Bass- Best choice for the bass lovers. Tuned in such a way to provide extra bass but still lacking in terms of punch. Sometimes it feels too much thumpy and loud and thus eats up the feel of the music.3. Touch- controls are convenient and work properly. Volum..."
AVINASH KUMAR,3,Decent product,"1. Sound quality worth in this price.2. Delay more than 30 sec in touch sensing.3. Sometimes touch sensing not working properly.4. Punchy , balanced sound.5.

Bharath Kumar ,2,Could be way better,"Iam using these buds it was good by looks and design, build quality but the sound quality is not that much expected the issue iam facing with these buds. I can hear outside noise clearly while you using these buds you have to increase to the full volume to ignore your surrounding noise.I definitely I will not recommend this buds for this price you have to look another best options in my opinion these buds are not value for money.

Anuj Dharam,5,Absolutely amazing buds for Audiophiles at the price :),"Amazing audio quality for the price. The build feels premium. I am an audiophile and I like to listen music on high volume. I can say there is no distortion even on full volume. Every vocal and instrument is clearly audible, and nothing is masked. Bass too is good. Battery on single charge lasts really long, I have been continuously using these for 5 days now. Absolutely amazed with the sound quality at the price. Call quality could be a bit better though but not bad to not recommend these :)"

Joshua Stephen Roy,4,Good choice,After 1week of use.Sound quality and bass are awsome. I recommend not to use more than 70% sound it will  cause pain for you ears because such a loud and deep bass sound in more than 75% sound quality. First 2 days earbud are a bit tight for my ear and cause pain but after that it is nice to use. Battery backup for earbud is satisfactory and it took 10 minites for 10% of charge. Charging time for earbud took less 1.5hours but for case i got 20-24 hours backup bit the company promises 28 hour...

Sound loudness dropped a bit after 1 week of usage. 5. Hinge is really weak. And I'm pretty sure it will get weaker over the time. 6. Flipkart return policies has hit the bottom.

Pratik Rathod,5,Awesome,The bass mode is surprisingly good. It doesn't interfere too much with the mids and the highs. does its job. I use it when i'm outside. For further tuning i just use my system equaliser to match the overall sound to my liking. takes one setup and then you can enjoy it then on.Call quality isn't great but you can take calls when there's not much background noise.The earbuds are comfortable. I just use the default buds.

The TWS are quite loud, I usually listen at 40-50% of the volume at most times and it is still enough in most conditions. The only lacking feature I feel it has is the missing battery percentage for its charging case because there is no way you can check that, until the case runs out of battery totally. Its not in the app, and not on the case itself."

Sai Shanmukh,4,Value-for-money,It's good at its price that is 1599 but if you are getting it at more price then don't choose it they are more better options in realme and at its price the bass and vocals are good and If you have oppo phone then go for it.It works very well with oppo phones(recent).

Ramesh Kumar Pradhan,5,Brilliant,It is very good product in the price range. And it looks like apple Air pods. Very cool design and awesome product. The sound is good and build is strong. I say go for it better than any other.
Tejas Upmanyu,5,Must buy!,I really like the quality of case. Its compact and easy to carry. The sound is very deep and clear. Amazing audio qualitya and deep bass. C type slot and cable with fast charging. A complete full package with minimum cost. Worth buying this.

Ajaykumar,5,Super!,This  XPODS  case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am   not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...
Devansh Baliyan,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."

Shritam Dutta,5,Worth every penny,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master.

amit  sarkar,5,Brilliant,This earpod is great. It's bass is awesome. In comparison to boat---if you looking for treble sound then go for boat xpod. But in case of bass sound just go for this one of boult. Boat earpods of this price has not even the ability to stand in front of this in comparison to bass sound. I have compared both by myself. The bass is just great nd powerful. I love it so much

On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

Tushar Keshla,5,Awesome,"According to the budget, it is worth buying. 1) Sound quality is good but not very good.2) Touch works fine, but doesn't distinguish between human touch or any other thing.. It responds even if u are wearing gloves which is good in most of the cases. 3) battery backup is good. Buds last for 1.5-2hrs and whole case backup is almost 10-11 hrs... So in a single case charge, u can charge the buds 3-4 times.. In the end, I would say it is amazing in such an affordable price"

Ravindra Parmar,2,Expected a better battery performance on this XPOd,Based on the usage of 1 day. The Xpods takes ~1.5 hr to charge and even lesser time (approx.: 50mins) to get discharged.
